# StatusChecker

## About
The status_checker gem allows users to check the status of a web site or
service.

status_checker will ping the provided URL 10 times, over the span of 60 seconds
and then report its findings using the form:

```
    {
      average_response_time: 0.2,
      failed_requests: 1,
      successful_requests: 9
    }
```

### Considerations
- The library currently drops response times for "bad" requests to the floor and
if no requests are successful, the average response time will be `nil`. It might
make sense for "bad" response times to be factored into the overall average
and/or create separate averages for "good"/"bad" response times.

- The library currently executes requests in serial. There is a timeout in
place and a dynamic value is used to pause the task between requests, but it
would be more foolproof to spawn a separate thread for each request. This way,
you could be _sure_  that the requests are executed exactly when they should
be (e.g. ten seconds apart) as there would be no chance of one requests
blocking another.

- Use Thor (or similar) to support command line options for number of requests,
the request buffer log levels, help text, etc.

- Use awesome_print (or similar) to add structure and style to output.
